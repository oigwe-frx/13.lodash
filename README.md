# Lodash

In this project, you will be implementing some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.
Weâ€™ve selected ten methods for you to implement.

## Method: .clamp()

This method implemented is .clamp(). <br>
.clamp() takes three arguments: a number, a lower bound, and an upper bound. The method modifies the provided number to be within the two provided bounds. If the provided number is smaller than the lower bound, it will return the lower bound as the final number. If the number is larger than the upper bound, it will return the upper bound as the final number. If the number is already within the two bounds, it will return the number as the final number.

## Method: .inRange()

This method takes three arguments: a number, a start value, and an end value. The method checks to see if the provided number falls within the range specified by the start and end values. If the provided number is smaller than the start value, .inRange() will return false. If the provided number is larger than or equal to the end value, .inRange() will return false. If no end value is provided to the method, the start value will be 0 and the end value will be the provided start value. If the provided start value is larger than the provided end value, the two values should be swapped.

## Method: .word()

This method takes one argument: a string. The method splits the string into an array of words.

---

## Method: .pad() 

This method takes two arguments: a string and a length. The method adds spaces evenly to both sides of the string to make it reach the desired length. Extra padding is added to the end of the string if an odd amount of padding is required to reach the specified length. 

---

## Method: .has()

This method takes two arguments: an object and a key, and checks to see if the provided object contains a value at the specified key.
